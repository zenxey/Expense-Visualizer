This tool is designed to help you analyze your Yes Bank transaction data by converting a bank statement to a JSON format and visualizing it with easy-to-understand charts.

How to Use the App
Follow these steps to extract and visualize your Yes Bank transaction data:

Step 1: Download the PDF Bank Statement
Download the PDF bank statement from the Yes Bank app or website. You can also request the statement to be sent to your email.
Note: This app works only with Yes Bank statements.
Step 2: Convert the PDF to XLS
Use the iLovePDF PDF to Excel converter (available at iLovePDF) to convert your downloaded bank statement PDF into an XLS file.
Step 3: Convert XLS to JSON
After converting the PDF to XLS, use an XLS to JSON converter (e.g., XLS to JSON Converter) to convert the XLS data into a JSON file.
Download the JSON file.
Step 4: Upload JSON to Visualize Data
Navigate to the Chart Page of the app.
Upload the JSON file to the app, and download the visual chart displaying your financial data (withdrawals, deposits, and balances).
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run eject
This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back. It removes the single build dependency and gives you full control over configuration files like webpack, Babel, and ESLint.
